# Reactive Capability Exercise

A browser-based power system simulation tool for training industry professionals on reactive power control and voltage regulation.

## Overview

This project migrates a Python/tkinter-based reactive power simulation to a modern web application using Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly). The tool provides real-time interactive simulation of generator reactive capability and voltage control systems.

## Features

- **Interactive Voltage Control**: Real-time voltage reference adjustment with slider and precision buttons
- **Live Visualization**: Animated charts showing voltage and reactive power responses
- **Newton-Raphson Power Flow**: Accurate power system calculations
- **Configuration Interface**: Adjustable simulation parameters
- **Single File Distribution**: Self-contained HTML application for easy deployment

## Quick Start

### For End Users
1. Download the `reactive-capability-exercise.html` file
2. Double-click to open in Microsoft Edge or any modern browser
3. Use the voltage reference controls to interact with the simulation

### For Developers
1. Clone this repository
2. Review the documentation:
   - `PRD.md` - Product requirements and specifications
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Development workflows and commands
   - `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Implementation details
3. Follow the development setup in `CLAUDE.md`
