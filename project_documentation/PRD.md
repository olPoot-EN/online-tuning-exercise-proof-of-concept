# Voltage Tuning Exercise - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing Python/tkinter-based Voltage Tuning Exercise simulation to a browser-based solution using Pyodide. The primary goal is to eliminate installation dependencies and IT restrictions that prevent effective distribution to power industry training participants.

**Project Scope**: Two-phase approach with immediate focus on local HTML file distribution, designed with future server-hosted deployment in mind.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Dependency Issues**: Students face Python environment conflicts and missing library problems
- **IT Restrictions**: Corporate security policies prevent executable installation
- **Setup Time Waste**: Significant training time lost to technical setup rather than learning
- **Distribution Complexity**: Current Python files require technical knowledge to run

### Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: 20 power industry professionals attending training sessions
- **Hardware**: Corporate-issued laptops, 0-6 years old, standard business specifications
- **Browser Environment**: Microsoft Edge (99% probability in utility company environments)
- **Timeline Constraint**: Solution needed in <1 month for upcoming training

## Phase 1: Local Distribution (Primary Deliverable)

### User Requirements

#### Distribution and Access
- **Single File Distribution**: Complete application contained in one HTML file
- **SharePoint Compatible**: File size and format suitable for corporate SharePoint download
- **Zero Installation**: Double-click HTML file opens functional application in browser
- **Offline Capable**: Full functionality without internet connection after initial load

#### User Interface
- **Professional Web Experience**: Modern browser-based UI/UX, not desktop application appearance
- **Voltage Control Interface**: 
  - Interactive slider for voltage reference adjustment (90-110% range, configurable)
  - Up/down setpoint buttons for precise control
  - Real-time display of reference and actual values
- **Real-time Visualization**: Smooth animated plots showing voltage and reactive power responses
- **Performance**: Fluid animations without choppiness on older corporate hardware

### Technical Requirements

#### Runtime Environment
- **Core Technology**: Pyodide (Python runtime in WebAssembly)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Chart.js for plotting
- **Architecture**: Python backend for calculations, JavaScript frontend for UI
- **File Size**: 10-15MB acceptable (includes Pyodide runtime)

#### Performance Specifications
- **Startup Time**: 
  - Initial load: <10 seconds maximum
  - Cached subsequent loads: <3 seconds maximum
- **Simulation Performance**: 
  - Update interval: 50ms (configurable)
  - Smooth real-time animation on 6-year-old corporate laptops
  - No frame drops or stuttering during continuous operation

#### Mathematical Accuracy
- **Newton-Raphson Solver**: Direct port of existing Python implementation
- **Calculation Verification**: All outputs must match original Python version exactly
- **Numerical Precision**: Maintain full precision of original floating-point calculations
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite comparing results across multiple scenarios

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Simulation Features

- **Power Flow Calculations**: Newton-Raphson solver with voltage regulation
- **Animated Plotting**: 
  - Voltage reference vs. actual voltage over time
  - Reactive power reference vs. actual reactive power over time
  - 10-second rolling window display
- **System Modeling**: Two-bus system with configurable parameters

#### Configuration Interface
- **Simulation Parameters**:
  - Simulation update interval (default 50ms)
  - Voltage reference range (extend beyond 90-110% for demonstrations)
  - System noise level (default 0.002 pu)
  - System reactance (default 0.05 pu)
  - Voltage controller gains (KP, KI)
- **Easy Access**: Configuration panel or settings interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Parameter changes take effect immediately

### Security Requirements

#### Intellectual Property Protection
- **Code Obfuscation**: JavaScript/HTML minification and obfuscation for production release
- **Casual Copy Protection**: Prevent easy code inspection and copying
- **Development Version**: Maintain readable code during development phase

#### Access Control
- **Time-based Expiration**: 
  - Configurable start date and duration (default 90 days)
  - Graceful degradation when expired (informational message)
  - Internal bypass mechanism for development/admin use
- **No Network Dependencies**: All security checks must work offline

## Phase 2: Server-Hosted Version (Future Considerations)

### Architectural Compatibility Requirements

#### Authentication Evolution
- **Phase 1**: Simple time-based expiration system
- **Phase 2**: Design for easy evolution to user login system
- **Consideration**: Authentication layer should be modular and replaceable

#### Configuration Management
- **Phase 1**: Embedded configuration parameters
- **Phase 2**: Plan for server-managed configuration profiles
- **Consideration**: Separate configuration logic for easy migration

#### Data Architecture
- **Phase 1**: Browser local storage for session data
- **Phase 2**: Database backend for user progress and analytics
- **Consideration**: Design data structures for easy server migration

#### Multi-User Support Planning
- **Future Features**: 
  - Instructor dashboard and controls
  - Session management for multiple students
  - Usage analytics and progress tracking
  - Shared scenarios and exercises
- **Current Consideration**: Code structure should not preclude these features

### Scalability Considerations
- **Target Load**: Up to 50 concurrent users
- **Server Architecture**: Plan for standard web server deployment
- **Performance**: Design for minimal server resource requirements
